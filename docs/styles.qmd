## [Themes](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/#themes)

There are 11 built-in themes provided for Reveal presentations (you can also create your own themes). The `default` and `dark` themes use fairly classic typography and color schemes and are a good place to start.

The `default` theme is used automatically â€” use the `theme` option in header to switch to an alternate theme. 

For example:

```markdown
---
title: "Presentation"
format:
  revealjs: 
    theme: dark
---
```

Here is the full list of available themes:

- beige
- blood
- dark
- default
- dracula
- league
- moon
- night
- serif
- simple
- sky
- solarized

## [Aside & Footnotes](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/#asides-footnotes)

Asides contain content of more peripheral interest, and are displayed in a smaller, lighter font at the bottom of the slide. Create asides using a div with the `aside` class. 

For example:

```markdown
## Slide Title

Slide content

::: aside
Some additional commentary of more peripheral interest.
:::
```

Footnotes have a similar visual treatment to asides, but include a footnote number. For example, here we use a footnote and an aside on a single slide:

```markdown
## Slide Title

- Green ^[A footnote]
- Brown
- Purple

::: aside
Some additional commentary of more peripheral interest.
:::
```
