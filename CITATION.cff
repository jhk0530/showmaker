  showmaker is an open‑source, cross‑platform desktop app
  that turns Markdown —often authored with generative
  AI—into Quarto‑based, interactive HTML slides. Built with
  Rust and Tauri, it offers a simple, user‑friendly
  interface with no command‑line setup. With a
  straightforward installer, built‑in theme support, and
  smooth integration with existing Markdown workflows,
  showmaker streamlines the path from draft to polished web
  slides.
