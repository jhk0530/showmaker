# showmaker

`showmaker` is an open‑source, cross‑platform desktop app that turns **Markdown** —often authored with generative AI—into Quarto‑based, interactive **HTML slides**. Built with `Rust` and `Tauri`, it offers a simple, user‑friendly interface with no command‑line setup. With a straightforward installer, built‑in theme support, and smooth integration with existing Markdown workflows, `showmaker` streamlines the path from draft to polished web slides.

## AI generated slide-markdown file

You can use this prompt to have an AI generate a markdown file.

```
Make a simple slide to introduce Tauri in markdown format.

1. The Markdown file must include a YAML header containing author, title, format, and embed-resources, as shown in the example below.

---
title: "This is title"
author: "Author"
format: revealjs
embed-resources: true
---

2. Each slide consists of a title and content, separated by # and -. For example:

# page1
- item 1
- item 2

# page2
- item 3
- item 4
```

and this will generate markdown like this:

```markdown
---
title: "Introduction to Tauri"
author: "Your Name"
format: revealjs
embed-resources: true
---

## Running Tests

showmaker includes a comprehensive test suite to ensure that Markdown parsing, Quarto rendering, and error handling work as expected.

To run all tests, execute:

```
cargo test
```

This will compile the project in test mode and run:

- Unit tests for YAML front matter validation
- Rendering tests (mocked) to verify HTML slide generation
- Error-handling tests for invalid input, unsupported formats, and missing dependencies

All tests are automated and can be run on any supported platform without requiring an internet connection.
